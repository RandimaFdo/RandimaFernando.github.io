            <br>
            <p1>I'm Randima Fernando and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of WestMinister. 
                <br>I am passionate about software development and I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and programming languages to enhance my skills.
                <br>Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering principles, data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture. 
                <br>I have also gained experience in software development through various projects and internships.
                <br>In my free time, I enjoy participating in coding challenges, attending hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. 
                <br>I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working in teams to solve complex problems.
                <br>My ultimate goal as a software engineer is to create innovative software solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives. 
                <br>I believe that technology can be used to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, and I am excited to be a part of that journey.
